# js-notes

- Created JavaScript notes chapter-wise for quick study would involve a comprehensive understanding of the JavaScript programming language and its core concepts.

- I have carefully organized the information into logical chapters, focusing on essential topics such as variables, functions, array, objects, promises and more.

- The notes are concise, easy to understand, and accessible for individuals with varying levels of expertise in JavaScript. They would include examples, explanations, and practical tips to help readers apply the concepts in real-world scenarios.
